            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>PLutarch</hi> writing concerning lives, ſaid, <hi>That he did but touch upon matters of action, becauſe he wrote Lives, and not Hiſtories;</hi> but in this Narrative I cannot yoke my pen to that ſtrict rule, becauſe <hi>Athanaſius</hi> his endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments cannot well be diſcovered but by his actions and ſufferings; nor they conſidered without the concurrence of the actions of his contemporaries, friends and enemies, fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>labourers, and Confeſſors, with his Anta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goniſts and Perſecutors; which neceſſarily draws me many times into a by-path con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Arianiſme, to find out <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> where the neglect of Writers have left him out of mind.</p>
            <p>I ſhall have much occaſion to glance upon the Principles of Religion concerning the Sacred Trinity, not medling with the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular diſputes which would be voluminous;
<pb facs="tcp:62811:3"/>the clear light concerning the Bleſſed Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity in Unity upon theſe later ages; and laſtly to leave a caveat to my dear Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey to hold theſe fundamentals concerning the Trinity, in conſtant adoration, eſpecially in theſe dayes, wherein ungodly rapes are ſo ordinarily committed upon them by the conceits of ſeeming reaſon, and thereby the Holy Spouſe of Chriſt divided into ſmall pieces, and ſcattered through the Nations.</p>

For firſt, profeſſors affecting the repute of extraordinary inſight in miſteries of Divinity, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to fancy ſublime doctrines, and to be tellers of news, of New Lights; and others no leſſe affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing curioſity, become their admirers and followers: nor was there formerly any power on earth to give a ſtop to ſuch extravagancies; For excommunication was become but a harmleſſe noiſe in repute of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny profeſſors, becauſe the defection was ſo great, that excommunication turned not men into the ſtate of heathens and publicans, <hi>but from a Church ſtrait laced, to a Church unbraced;</hi> and thus He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſies flowed in amain in the third Century, more then formerly they had done: Which made that holy man <hi>Baſil</hi> to mourn exceedingly, and entring into a deep ſcrutiny for the Cauſe, could find none other then, <hi>Propter unius magni veri &amp; ſolius om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nium regni contemptum,</hi>

                     <hi>Sect.</hi> 4.</note> then the other was derogatory to Gods honour, which was a tide of Schiſme. For the firſt Churches in the Primitive times after the Apoſtolick Times expired, were
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:62811:6"/>governed in their Atomes of Congregations ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered, not out of other Chriſtian Congregations, as now-a-dayes, but out of the heathens; and they at the firſt conſiſted by the rule, partly of the writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten word, and partly of Apoſtolical Tradition. And yet were thoſe not independant, as now the gathered Churches are; but in caſes of difficulty they had recourſe to aſſociation of Councils, who did not onely adviſe, but impoſe upon the Churches, and they alſo conſcientiouſly did ſubmit to conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions determined by ſuch Councils. But in after ages, when the Canon of the Scripture was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleated, the rule then left was the Scripture, Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolical traditions and concluſions of Councils, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled upon occaſion according to the ancient Cuſtome; unto which the Churches did ſtill ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, ſo long as the ſame were according to the Word of God.</p>
               <p>But as touching the execution of ſuch concluſions,<note place="margin">

For as God hath determined that every member of the Church ſhall live in a continual war within himſelf; ſo alſo ſhall the Church have Hereſies and Schiſmes, that they which are approved, may be made manifeſt. But above all the reſt of the Schiſmes ariſing within the Church, wherewith it hath been tried, two eſpecially have exceeded; the one befalling in the Eaſtern Churches, which was that of <hi>Arius,</hi> who indeavoured to pull Chriſt from his Throne, by denying of his Divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.

                  <hi>Antioch,</hi> and relateth to him how he was dealt with at <hi>Alexandria.

The Emperour hearkens to <hi>Euſebius,</hi> and thenceforth <hi>Euſebius</hi> grows into repute of a Favourite and a Councellor to the Emperor in Church Matters; and in all ſuch caſes men flock to him as to their Mediatory Angel; and being thus lifted up, he thinks his word may prevail with <hi>Alexander</hi> the Alexandrian Biſhop, more then <hi>Alexanders</hi> reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; and therefore he writes to him, and adviſes him to paſſe by the matter concerning <hi>Arius,</hi> and to re-admit him and his party into Church Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion again; but unto other Churches he writes to ſtir them up to with-ſtand the proceedings of the Alexandrian Church. And amongſt others he writes to the Meletians, which he might well have ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, for they were more forward therein then himſelf.

               <p>Now begins the glory of <hi>Conſtantines</hi> Chriſtian government to wane, and fall ſhort of expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,<note place="margin">Sect. <hi>8.</hi>
                  </note> by the riſing clouds of errour; he ſees it, and it vexeth him at the heart. <hi>Silveſter</hi> alſo Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> (to whom alſo the Emperour did give ear for his advice in affairs of the Church) is no leſſe af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:62811:13"/>at the news hereof; and by his advice a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Council is called at <hi>Alexandria,</hi> whereunto he ſends <hi>Hoſſius</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Corduba</hi> in <hi>Spain,</hi> with his Letters. This Biſhop took his journey by <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> and finding the Emperout at <hi>Nico<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>media,</hi> is received by him courteouſly, and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with the Imperial Letters Authoritative, to the Council at <hi>Alexandria,</hi> beſides other Letters, amongſt which was one written to <hi>Alexander</hi> the Biſhop and <hi>Arius</hi> to this purpoſe, telling them,

<q rend="margQuotes">That He took notice of their difference, that the matters were miſterious, not eaſie to be explai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to the people, much leſſe to be underſtood by them. That their Faith was one and the ſame: That their differences were <hi>parvae levicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lae exiguae,</hi> ſmall petty trifles: That their que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion was a fooliſh queſtion: That the peace of the people ought to prevail with them, if not to think the ſame, yet to abſtain from publique conteſts: That otherwiſe it would make his Reigne troubleſome, and his life irkſome. That he was coming to them, but was adviſed and told that he could never endure to ſee, what is ſo grievous to him to hear. He prayes them to ſtudy peace and unity, and forbear further ſtrifes, that he may have cauſe of joy in his meeting with them.</q>

And thus the Emperour acted the part either of a young Chriſtian, that knew not the value of the Miſtery of the Holy Trinity; or of his favorite <hi>Euſebins,</hi> by whoſe ſpectacles he looked upon the affaires of the Eaſtern Churches; or of a politick Emperour, that for maintaining of peace would adventure his pen to declare that

               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:62811:18"/>
               <p>They further proceeded to determine matters concerning the government of the Church,<note place="margin">Sect. <hi>7.</hi>
                  </note> by confirming the government by Provincial Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils, under the Paſtors of the Mother Churches Biſhops, Presbyters and Deacons; each of them to enjoy the ſame powers which Cuſtomary permiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Churches had formerly allowed to them. Nothing can I find that <hi>de nova</hi> was granted to them; but rather ſuch power which by corruption was encroached, was thereby regulated and reſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. And thus for the future there ſeems hereby a door ſhut and barred againſt Schiſme and hereſie, ſo long as Provincial Councils and their members are true to themſelves or to the Church of God, and the Chriſtian Magiſtrate will be Chriſtian indeed, to execute the Law as he ought to do.</p>
               <p>For before the Council at <hi>Nice,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Sect. <hi>8.</hi>
                  </note> the prudential agreement of Churches and Councils, in Aſſocia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, or apart by themſelves, bound no further then ingenuity or conſcience did lead any party or perſon, and under no worſe penalty then Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or if you will Excommunication, from this or that Church, which ſome might account a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledg in thoſe days as well as now; and what was the fruit of all? but Sects, Schiſmes, Hereſies, and the Spirits of Profeſſors never ſatisfied, but ſtill lingring, as now a-days after new opinions and liberty from being under Church Government, which they call, <hi>Liberty of conſcience.</hi> This ſore the Nicene Council well eyed, and ſeeing no other way in humane opinion to prevent the worſt; found it neceſſary to bind the Government of the Church under the Law of the Chriſtian Magiſtrate; and
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:62811:19"/>therefore having finiſhed their concluſions, tendred them to be confirmed by the Seal of the Imperial power, by which they had aſſembled themſelves, and under other penalties beſides that of ſeparation. And hereby the Chriſtian Magiſtrates power be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes incorporate into the government of the Church in all caſes where the Law of God deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines not otherwiſe, to enforce the determinations of the Church, as by the Law the Magiſtrate is enabled to do. And therefore if any Congregation will independ, or be at liberty from the power of the Chriſtian Magiſtrate, in ſuch caſes they do not only outlaw themſelves, but upon their own prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple allow every one of their fellow members to conſiſt with them, in no other manner then they did in the Churches before <hi>Conſtantines</hi> Converſion, under a liberty to ſeparate to any ſchiſm or error, as they ſhall pleaſe; and as it were thruſt out the Chriſtian Magiſtrate from abiding in the inheritance of the Lord, and leave him to ſerve other Gods, as <hi>Conſtantine</hi> did before his Converſion; which thing no Church or Congregation of Chriſtians, though never ſo ſchiſmatical, ever did, althouth they held their principles of ſeparation in as high account as any in theſe dayes can pretend unto; until of later times the Anabaptiſts in <hi>Germany</hi> brought that principle into the Church. But forbearing further digreſſion herein, I ſhall proceed with the ſubject in hand.</p>
               <p>The determinations of the Nicene Council being thus concluded,<note place="margin">Sect. <hi>9.</hi>
                  </note> the Biſhops and members are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to ſubſcribe the ſame; and amongſt the reſt, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venteen of them are obſerved to decline their ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:62811:19"/>being ſomewhat inſnared in the Arian Principles: and the concluſions of the Council at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted are preſented to the Emperors conſideration; who highly applauding the ſame, declared that all ſuch as had refuſed to ſubſcribe thereto,<note place="margin">Ruffin. <hi>lib.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 5.</note> ſhould be forthwith baniſhed; whereupon eleven of thoſe ſeventeen who were diſſenters do now ſubmit, and do ſubſcribe the ſame; though ſome were more willing then others. And thus are the Church de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees now backed, not only with the penalty of Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical, but alſo with civil excommunication,<note place="margin">Theod. <hi>lib.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 12.</note> which was accompanied alſo with loſs of habitation and perſonal eſtate.

                  <note place="margin">Soz. <hi>lib.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 15.</note> but how, or upon what occaſion Writers do not mention, yet it ſeems he was reſtrained from re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning to <hi>Alexandria.</hi> For they that mention his return thither, make it to be about the laſt year of <hi>Conſtantines</hi> Empire, which was about ten years after <hi>Arius</hi> his baniſhment. And that this favour was ſhewed to <hi>Arius,</hi> is evident from the ſuppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation that <hi>Euſebius</hi> and <hi>Theognis</hi> made to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour; for therein they take notice of the favour done to <hi>Arius,</hi> who is the principal in the matter ſentenced by the Emperour and the Nicene Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil;
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:62811:20"/>and therefore they beſeech the Emperors le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity as to themſelves alſo. It may ſeem alſo that <hi>Arius</hi> had gained that favour by retractation of his errours:<note place="margin">Soc. <hi>lib.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 20.</note> For both <hi>Euſebius</hi> and <hi>Theognis</hi> made their retractations alſo, which they preſented to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror, and the Biſhops, wherein they do declare,

<q>That they do conſent to the Confeſſion of the Faith, agreed upon by the Nicene Council, and do promiſe that they will ſtudy the peace of the Church; and further more they ſhew the cauſe of their refuſal to ſubſcribe the Confeſſion, was not that they did diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree from the ſame faith with the Council, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they could not conſent to the ſentence againſt <hi>Arius,</hi> who had in private conference with them declared that his judgement was other then what was apprehended by the Council. And therefore they pray to be admitted to ſubſcribe their conſent to the Confeſſion of Faith, as it was agreed by the Council; Though not ſo much (ſaid they) to avoid the penalty of baniſhment, as that they might not lie under the heavy burthen of being reputed Hereticks, being nevertheleſſe willing to ſubmit to the determination of the Council. And they the rather beſeech this, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Emperour and Biſhops had permitted him who was deemed by them the principal offender, to return and have courteous entertainment with them.</q>

He is enforced to flee for his liberty, and to ſeek his reparation from the Emperour by way of appeal from the Council to his definitive ſentence, as the ſupream power in all cauſes, as well Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical as Civil. This is the firſt preſident of that kind that is found in ſtory, (for <hi>Conſtantine</hi> was the firſt Chriſtian Emperour) and is commended to poſterity by the example of ſo worthy a man as <hi>Athanaſius</hi> was, who was the firſt lèader herein.

It is ſuppoſed that <hi>Conſtantia</hi> did this accordingly ſoon after, but it might be left out of mind: For afterward <hi>Conſtantia</hi> falling ſick of her laſt ſickneſs, and the Emperour coming to vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſit her, amongſt other things ſhe glanced upon the matter concerning <hi>Arius,</hi> and therein ſpake much in commendation of her Presbyter, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended him to the Emperors favour; telling him that her Presbyter was a man of parts, zealous of the Emperours honour, and a very godly man: The Emperour taking this as her laſt requeſt (for ſhe died ſoon after) did accordingly; for he ſent for the Presbyter, and commanded him to wait upon
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:62811:29"/>him. This act of the Emperour; though but an act of love to his ſiſter, and might ſeem of ſmall importance; yet (as the times then ſtood) proved the great hinge upon which the affairs of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire in relation to the Church did turn. So dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous a thing it is for them in authority to intruſt their favour unto any private relation, eſpecially to a woman whoſe affections many times are ſtrong and predominate; and in the general, are more skilfull at making of fires then men are.</p>
               <p>This new favourite that <hi>Conſtantine</hi> had ſo eaſily gained, crept up by degrees into his boſome:<note place="margin">

And he further told the Emperour, that if he would pleaſe to admit <hi>Arius</hi> into his preſence, <hi>Arius</hi> was very deſirous to give the Emperour full ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction therein. The Emperour was well pleaſed herewith, and told the Presbyter, That if <hi>Arius</hi> be of the ſame judgment with the Nicene Council, the Emperour would not only admit him into his preſence, but he would reſtore him to his Church at <hi>Alexandria:</hi> and for further aſſurance herein, the Emperour wrote his Letters to <hi>Arius,</hi> ſignify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his pleaſure, that <hi>Arius</hi> ſhould come and ſpeak with the Emperour.

<pb n="54" facs="tcp:62811:30"/>into the Emperours preſence, he asked <hi>Arius</hi> if he did agree to the Nicene Faith? and they both anſwered that they did agree thereto, The Emperour then required them to ſet down their faith in writing: which thing they after alſo did, and preſented the ſame as the faith of them and their followers, to this purpoſe:</p>
               <q>
                  <note place="margin">Soz. <hi>lib.</hi> 2 <hi>cap.</hi> 26.</note>We believe in one God, the Father Almighty: and in one Lord Jeſus Chriſt, his Son, begotten of him before all ages: True God; by whom all things are made in Heaven and in Earth; who deſcended, and is incarnate, and ſuffered, and roſe again; and aſcended into Heaven: and ſhall come again to judg both the quick and the dead. And in the Holy Ghoſt: in the reſurrection of the fleſh: in eternal life in the Kingdom of Heaven. In one Catholick Church of God, extending throughout all the Earth.</q>
               <p>This Faith they ſaid they received from the Goſpel; the Lord Jeſus Chriſt ſaying to his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, <hi>Go and teach all nations, ſanctifying them in the Name of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt;</hi> as the whole Catholick Church and Scriptures do teach: <hi>in which</hi> (ſaid they) <hi>we wholly believe God is our Judg, both now, and at the laſt judgment.</hi> This writing the Emperour peruſed, and asked <hi>Arius</hi> if he had ought more to ſay; and whether from his heart he did truly own what he did pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs? To which <hi>Arius</hi> anſwered, that he had not ought more to ſay, nor hath he written or ſaid other, or otherwiſe, then according to his judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The Emperor hereto replied, <hi>If your faith

               </p>
               <p>It ſeems the Emperour was not yet ſatisfied with the reality of theſe men,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Sect.</hi> 4.</note> and therefore will deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine nothing herein, without Counſel, contrary to the determinations of the Council at <hi>Tyrus,</hi> which is in his opinion meet for the purpoſe.

                  <note place="margin">Theod. <hi>lib.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 30.</note> to adjourn their meeting to <hi>Hieruſalem,</hi> to aſſiſt him in that work: and they are as forward therein as himſelf; For building of Churches, and a pompous devotion, will ſolder well enough with Arianiſm, to overlay the ſame with the gold of ſeeming holineſs. And unto this Council at <hi>Hieruſalem, Conſtantine</hi> refers the matter concerning <hi>Arius,</hi> ſending him thither with his Confeſſion of Faith by him ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed; requiring them to examine him ſtrictly concerning the ſame, and if they find him and the Confeſſion good, then to ſhew him favour: So is <hi>Athanaſius</hi> his appeal deferred till the dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation be paſt, and he gone to <hi>Alexandria.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Sozom. <hi>lib.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 26.</note> But the Council being met at <hi>Hieruſalem,</hi> acdording to the Emperours direction, ſpeedily take <hi>Arius</hi> his matter into conſideration; and find him Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox, and his Confeſſion good, and acquit him from the cenſure of the Nicene Council, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit him to his Church at <hi>Alexandria.</hi> Hereof
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:62811:31"/>they give notice by Letters to the Biſhops and Presbyters of <hi>Egypt</hi> and <hi>Alexandria,</hi> telling them, that <hi>Arius</hi> his faith was good, that the Emperor had ſo declared it upon the Councils determination at <hi>Hieruſalem,</hi> and that they had admitted <hi>Arius</hi> again to his Church at <hi>Alexandria;</hi> and therefore prayed them to accept him into communion with them, as before times they had done. And they further wrote to the Emperor, and informed him what they had done concerning <hi>Arius,</hi> ſo as he now ſtands right in the Emperors opinion, who granted to <hi>Arius</hi> alſo his Imperial Letters directed to the Church at <hi>Alexandria,</hi> injoyning them to admit <hi>Arius</hi> unto his Church and communion with them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves again. And thus a fault is committed, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the Emperor may politically be acquitted, in that he followed the advice of a Council: but in a Theological ſenſe He ſtands doubtful; for he could not but underſtand the principles of thoſe perſons who were the prevailing part of the Council: but as touching the Council it ſelf, it neither was Theologically nor Politically innocent: For they that will erre at <hi>Tyrus,</hi> will alſo erre at <hi>Hieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem.</hi>
               </p>

But the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, however Chriſtian he was, yet now appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending his Authority again flighted by <hi>Athana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius,</hi> was angry, and wrote to <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling him, that it is the Emperors expreſſe will and pleaſure, that all ſuch as ſhall deſire to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted into Church fellowſhip with the Church at <hi>Alexandria,</hi> ſhall have free liberty to joyn there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, and be admitted thereto.

               <p>Said like an Emperor and not a Chirſtian Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate that muſt govern by Law,<note place="margin">Sect. <hi>6.</hi>

And therefore in all this, there can be no preſident of the Chriſtian Magiſtrates, intereſt above the Eccleſiaſtical, nor of the Eccleſiaſtical intereſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependant upon the Chriſtian Magiſtrate, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard the general Councils were not purely Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical, but mixt of both intereſts, and ſo conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued

For after the newes hereof was blown abroad, the Alexandrian Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches do not onely by ſervent prayers to God night and day, but by all the means that they could in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent, importune the Emperor to relent; They peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the Emperor themſelves, many others do the like; the Monks of the Wilderneſſe are not behind: But above all that famous Monk <hi>Anthony</hi> (whom all Chriſtians honoured,<note place="margin">Athan. <hi>Apol.</hi> 2.</note> even <hi>Conſtantine</hi> himſelf and all his Sons and Courtiers) who wrote divers Letters to the Emperour in <hi>Athanaſius</hi> his behalf, praying him to take heed of the Meletians, for though their Doctrines were good, yet their pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice was ſcandalous, their informations calumni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and ſhewed little conſcience of truth (are there none like theſe men in theſe dayes?) But no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing will prevail, the Emperor returns negatives to all; he tells the Alexandrians, that themſelves are pertinacious and turbulent, and commanded
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:62811:33"/>them, their Clerks and Virgins, to be quiet, for he will not call home <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> nor recede from what he had done. That <hi>Athanaſius</hi> was condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the Council, and was a ſeditious and unquiet man. He told alſo <hi>Anthony</hi> the Monk, that he could not diſown the proceedings of the Council at <hi>Tyre</hi> againſt <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> that though ſome might be his enemies, yet is it not to be believed that ſo many learned men ſhould ſo fouly miſcarry, as to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne him without juſt cauſe.

For <hi>Baronius</hi> taketh much pains to mollifie the harſhneſs of this act of <hi>Conſtantine</hi> (poſſibly from regard of the honor of the Roman Church ſo highly extolled by <hi>Conſtantine</hi> as they report) as if all had been done in policy to maintain the publique peace, and in favour to <hi>Athanaſius</hi> in conveying him out of the way of the deadly purſuit of the Meletians and Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.

The Emperour awakened thereat, ſends for <hi>Arius,</hi> and askes him what the matter is, that where-ever he goes ſtill Tumults follow him? and whether he doth really agree with the Nicene Faith? And again he profeſſedly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voweth that he doth fully agree thereto. The Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour commandeth him to ſet the ſame down in writing under his hand, which he did in the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours preſence:<note place="margin">Soc. <hi>lib.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 25.</note> Hereto the Emperour requires his oath to manifeſt that he is real in the ſame; and he as readily maketh oath, that what he had

But the Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian ſaith,<note place="margin">Theod. <hi>lib.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 14.</note> that (to ſave <hi>Arius</hi> from a plain lie and perjury) at the ſame time <hi>Arius</hi> had his private opinion in his own ſence under his own hand in writing, which then he alſo kept under his arm when he made his oath; and that <hi>Arius</hi> ſwore in relation to that, and not to what he ſubſcribed in the Emperours preſence.

                  </note> it might be expected that the quarrel concerning <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thanaſius</hi> might find the eaſier compoſal, and that the Emperour <hi>Conſtantine</hi> will now be perſwaded to agree to his reſtoring to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexandria;</hi>

Neither will Gods judgments from Heaven, nor mediation on earth prevail againſt <hi>Conſtantines</hi> Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, whatever they were. For now that <hi>Arius</hi> is gone, <hi>Euſebius</hi> his Champion doth ſo much the more mightily lay about him in the Arian cauſe, having alſo the other Biſhops to ſecond him, who once engaged, count it a diſparagement to be ſcared with the ſtrangeneſs of <hi>Arius</hi> his death; and ſo the Alexandrian Churches cannot prevail to have ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, no not from <hi>Conſtantine;</hi> nor will he regain his honour of doing juſtice herein ſo long as he lives; and yet he carries the matter ſo, as the Euſebians ſhall gain no ground thereby: For leaſt he ſhould ſeem to favour the Hereticks, he pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhes an edict againſt them, taking away their Churches, commanding their members to joyn themſelves in communion with the Orthodox
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:62811:36"/>Churches; forbiding alſo the meetings of the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks, whether in publick, or private; all which he might well do, and yet little hurt to the Arian cauſe: For they are of the Meletian Churches, and ſo in the repute of <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> Legal men;<note place="margin">Soz. <hi>lib.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 30.</note> they could own or diſown Churches at pleaſure, and therefore out of the dint of the edict; and yet are as ill as the worſt of thoſe that are within the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs of the edict. For all this therefore <hi>Conſtantine</hi> is not a declared enemy to the Arians as yet; nor will he be till they prove unquiet: Nay they, and they alone, as touching Church affairs, ſhall be his Counſellours and Courtiers, ſo long as they will let him have peace in his Throne, though they turn the Lord Jeſus Chriſt out of his Throne. And there were two things more that befell in the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours life time, which do much countenance the truth thereof. For firſt, (if his beloved Hiſtorian <hi>Euſebius</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Caeſaria</hi> may be believed) <hi>Conſtantine</hi> received the Sacrament of Baptiſm, in nature of a <hi>viaticum</hi> a little before his death,<note place="margin">Euſeb. vit. Conſt.</note> not by the adminiſtration of <hi>Alexander</hi> Biſhop of his Imperial City, as might have becomed an Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, but by the hands of <hi>Euſebius</hi> of <hi>Nicome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia,</hi> the patron of the Arian party; and if ſo, the ſame was no good ſign. But if <hi>Baronius</hi> his relation may be believed, its much worſe; for he proveth,<note place="margin">Baron. <hi>An.</hi>
                  </note> according to his manner, that <hi>Conſtantine</hi> had been baptized by <hi>Sylveſter</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> and then if <hi>Euſebius</hi> alſo ſaith true, he was rebaptized; and that ſhewes that he loved the Nicomedian water better then the Roman. But there is a ſecond ſign of <hi>Conſtantines</hi> diſpoſition, as ill, if not worſe then
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:62811:37"/>the former whereby he did (as much as in him did lye) ſtake the very Subſiſtence of the Orthodox party at the caſt of the Dice, which was the truſt that ſtill he repoſed in the Arian Presbyter com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended to him by his Siſter <hi>Conſtantia.</hi> For he tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted him with the keeping of his laſt Will, and delivery thereof to his Son <hi>Conſtantius</hi> after his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers death, as if <hi>Conſtantine</hi> intended therewith to commend the Presbyter alſo to <hi>Conſtantius,</hi> as a man meet to be truſted by him; and alſo to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend to <hi>Conſtantius</hi> whatſoever the Presbyter ſhould bring along with him; and what ſad conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences enſued thereupon accordingly, will appear afterward: yet if in all this his rule was that of po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy, it muſt be acknowledged he adventured ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what too much to gain peace, and yet when all is done, at the beſt he had but a troubleſome Reigne.</p>
               <p>Againſt theſe ſad ſymptomes of <hi>Conſtantines</hi> diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition,<note place="margin">Sect. <hi>2.</hi>
                  </note> I muſt do him that right as to ballance therewith two other, mentioned by Writers, which ſeem to ſhew that <hi>Conſtantines</hi> judgment in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Religion was Orthodox. One of which was that he cauſed his three Sons <hi>Conſtantine, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantius,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Euſeb. <hi>Vit.</hi> Conſt. <hi>lib.</hi> 4. <hi>cap.</hi> 52. <hi>Ibid. cap.</hi> 32.</note> and <hi>Conſtans,</hi> to be trained up in Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox principles, two of which Sons held conſtant their Profeſſion. The ſecond thing was his Oration to the Saints, written by him, and publiſhed by <hi>Euſebius</hi> of <hi>Caeſaria;</hi> wherein, eſpecially in the tenth Chapter of that Oration, he aſſerts the Deity of Chriſt. He might therefore be well principled, but how far in his age might be drawn aſide by the flatteries of the Arians, may be conceived by what
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:62811:37"/>is written of him; for it is evident that his policy ſometimes did divide between his judgment and affections; and upon that occaſion that vertue that ſo much ſounded in his name and the names of his Sons appeared but dimly many times; for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf could ſometimes cenſure ſome as if they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved never to be truſted, and again truſt them as if they never deſerved cenſure; and that may ſeem to be the principal cauſe of <hi>Eutropius</hi> his cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of him, that he was <hi>Primo Imperii tempore Optimis Principibus, altimo mediis comparandus.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Eutrop. <hi>Vit.</hi> Conſt.</note> A man in his firſt time equal to the beſt of Princes, but in his later times inferiour; yet in the general ſtream of his government he ſhewed himſelf wiſe, couragious, and after his manner zealous in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement of Gods Worſhip, though in his later times more for the Ceremony, and ſcarce ſhort of Superſtition, the ordinary fault of Chriſtian Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. He executed the greateſt part of his will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he made it; which was the diſpoſing of his Empire amongſt his three Sons, and ſetling them therein, whiles he was yet alive. He made his ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Son <hi>Constantius</hi> his Execuor; yet bequeathed <hi>Athanaſius</hi> to his eldeſt Son <hi>Conſtantine</hi> to reſtore him to his place at <hi>Alexandria;</hi> ſo as it ſeemeth the equity of <hi>Athanaſius</hi> his caſe reſted with <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine,</hi> though he paſſed Sentence againſt him. The certain time of the beginning of his Life and Raign, and the continuance thereof are all uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, yet it is certain that he died; but the moſt approved account by Hiſtorians is, that his Raign began about the year of our Lord three hundred and ſix, and continued with <hi>Maximinus, Max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entius,</hi>
                  <pb n="70" facs="tcp:62811:38"/>and <hi>Licinus,</hi> or one of them, till about the year three hundred twenty and four, and thenceforth, until about three hundred thirty and ſeven he raigned alone, and died in the ſixty ſixth year of his age.</p>
               <p>After his death his three Sons ſucceed him in their ſeveral parts of the Empire.<note place="margin">Sect. <hi>3.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the eldeſt had his lot in the weſtern parts of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, bounded on the Eaſt by the unconquered parts of <hi>Germany,</hi> containing the <hi>Britiſh Iſles, Spain, France, Germany. Conſtans</hi> the youngeſt had <hi>Illiricum, Greece</hi> and <hi>Affrick,</hi> and it ſeemeth <hi>Italy. Conſtantius</hi> had <hi>Thracia, Conſtantinople,</hi> and what was conquered in <hi>Aſia. Conſtantine</hi> the el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt was like his Father in affecting greatneſſe, but not in ſucceſſe: For he thought he might be bold with his youngeſt brother <hi>Conſtans,</hi> and endeavou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to gain <hi>Italy</hi> from him, but therein he loſt his life in the field, and therewith that part of the Empire diſſolved to <hi>Conſtans</hi> by way of Conqueſt, after that his eldeſt brother had raigned about three years. <hi>Conſtans</hi> alſo was a brave and a juſt man, till he grew diſabled for action by the Gowt, but then betaking himſelf to eaſe, he contracted diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and grew into diſlike of the people, and was murthered by <hi>Magnentius,</hi> who had been his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, after he had raigned about ſeventeen years. Both theſe Emperors continued friends to the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox Chriſtians during their times; but they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing dead, the whole Empire remained to <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius;</hi> yet could he not gain quiet poſſeſſion without the Sword. For <hi>Magnentius</hi> had gotten poſſeſſion of <hi>Conſtans</hi> his part of the Empire, but he loſt his
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:62811:38"/>life, or rather caſt it away in the quarrel with <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantius;</hi> which coſt the Empire ſo much blood, as for want of Souldiers, the Northern people had an eaſie entrance opened to them into the Empire, to the utter ruin thereof in the concluſion.</p>
               <p>The beginnings of the Raigns of theſe three Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors are ſo differently obſerved by Writers, as it makes the order of ſtory concerning all affairs per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed, and amongſt the reſt of thoſe affaires, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>Athanaſius.</hi> For ſometimes they reflect upon the death of <hi>Constantine</hi> the Father, as the beginning of the Raigns of his Sons; and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times upon their ſeveral entries upon their govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the life-time of their Father; and they obſerve that <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the Son began his Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the tenth year of his Fathers Raign,<note place="margin">

               <p>The beginning of his Raigne therefore will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fal about the three hundred and ſeven and thirtieth year after the Incarnation of Chriſt,<note place="margin">Sect. <hi>5.</hi>

A cunning man doubtleſſe this Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byter was, who being thus in favour with two Emperors ſucceſſively, did nevertheleſſe thus cloud himſelf, kept at Court, do ſo much, and yet no more, then a nameleſſe Presbyter all this while.

                  </note> firſt with the ſervants at the Court, then with the Empreſſe, and then with the Emperor, ſpreading this Arian infection as Leaven through the Imperial Family, and from thence into the City of <hi>Conſtantinople.</hi> And thus as God had formerly made uſe of the Imperial power to induce and propagate Religion, ſo now the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil makes uſe of the like power to propagate er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, yet with this difference, Gods will is done in both.</p>

<pb n="80" facs="tcp:62811:43"/>had ſummoned a Council to be holden at <hi>Antioch</hi> for the ſolemn Conſecrating of a Church there, which formerly was begun by <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the Great, and now finiſhed by <hi>Conſtantius.</hi> A fair pretence of building of Churches: but moſt men underſtood them aright, that it was rather for the pulling down of the Church of Chriſt by ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment of <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> which is generally known they threaten. And for this cauſe divers of the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox Biſhops come not at all; and others of them that are in their journey are ſeized upon, and impriſoned by the way; and by that unjuſt means many eſcaped ſtrong temptations, which otherwiſe they had been expoſed unto by their preſence at the Council.<note place="margin">Sozom. <hi>lib.</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 5.</note> Nevertheleſs there met at that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil one hundred Biſhops ſaving one, and amongſt the reſt <hi>Euſebius,</hi> now Biſhop of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> failed not; for <hi>Athanaſius</hi> is his deſigned morſel, without which his appetite cannot be ſatisfied; yet its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable he miſſed his expectation: for if he were at the beginning of the work, before he could ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low what he imagined was his own, death took him out of the way, and carried him to his laſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count concerning the Deity of the Son of God,<note place="margin">Sozom. <hi>lib.</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 6. Niceph. <hi>Hiſt. lib.</hi> 9. <hi>cap.</hi> 7.</note> and concerning the outrages done to the people of God. Nevertheleſs the Council goes on, and <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi> himſelf ſees to the chace, and <hi>Athanaſius</hi> his matter comes to conſideration, although he nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was preſent, nor for ought appears, was ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moned.

<pb n="81" facs="tcp:62811:43"/>come thither, he raiſed Tumults amongſt the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; wherein ſome are ſlain, others impriſoned, and other otherwiſe puniſhed. And laſtly, for want of other matters, they revived the complaints raiſed againſt him at the Council of <hi>Tyrus,</hi> and theſe are charged againſt him anew. How unjuſtly theſe things are thus charged againſt <hi>Athanaſius</hi> may thus appear; The laſt charge concerning the matters at the Council at <hi>Tyrus,</hi> needed no an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, for they were buried in their very birth, and their own evidence failing, can never be revived. The ſecond Article concerning Tumults, was by the Apologetical Epiſtle of the Alexandrian Church declared to be falſe; wherein they tell <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantius,</hi> that the Catholick Church uſes no ſuch weapons in their warfare as death, impriſonment, bonds, or corporal puniſhments, concerning which the civil Magiſtrate can give further accompt. And as to the firſt charge, it was a wilfull miſtake; For <hi>Athanaſius</hi> was not baniſhed by the Emperour in order to the ſentence of the Council at <hi>Tyrus,</hi> which depended upon appeal before him, but upon new matters originally ariſing before him; and theſe being of a political conſideration concerning the publick peace; the Emperour might as well reſtore <hi>Athanaſius</hi> without the Council, as baniſh him without the Council.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Athanaſius</hi> caſt a block in the way of their whole proceedings: he ſaw their intentions;<note place="margin">Sect. <hi>2.</hi>
                  </note> for who ſaw them not? he therefore delayes his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing at <hi>Antioch,</hi> if he were ſummoned, and left them to proceed without hearing of both parts. This being underſtood by <hi>Conſtantius,</hi> he ſends to
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:62811:44"/>apprehend <hi>Athanaſius;</hi> but he being aware there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, withdrew himſelf out of the way,<note place="margin">Soz. <hi>lib.</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 5, 8.</note> and hid him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf for the preſent, and afterwards eſcaped away to <hi>Rome.</hi> Some write that he was ſent for by the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> upon the Letters of complaint from <hi>Euſebius;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Theod. <hi>lib.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 4</note> and both may be true; for after that <hi>Euſebius</hi> had ſent his Letters, its ſaid that the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> anſwered the ſame by his Letters; and intimated, that <hi>Athanaſius</hi> could not with ſafety come for trial where ſo much prejudice was againſt him; and therefore he tells <hi>Euſebius,</hi> that thoſe matters againſt <hi>Athanaſius</hi> ſhould be heard at <hi>Rome,</hi> where alſo a Council was to be holden, and where order ſhould be taken for <hi>Athanaſius</hi> his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing. And accordingly <hi>Euſebius</hi> and the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiochian Council in their reply to <hi>Julius</hi> his Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters did agree thereto, and promiſed to ſend to <hi>Rome</hi> their charge againſt <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> with their Delegates to proceed againſt him. And this might be a ground for the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> to ſend to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thanaſius</hi> to come to <hi>Rome,</hi> and for the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> at the Council there to hear the Cauſe, and for the Council at <hi>Antioch</hi> to ſend their delegates thither; and yet no Supremacy hereby veſted in the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> over the Aſian or Affrican Churches.</p>
               <p>Thus eſcaped <hi>Athanaſius</hi> to <hi>Rome,</hi>

And all this done by a Vote pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured as ill as all the reſt:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Athan.</hi> Apol. <hi>2.</hi> Epiſt. Jul. Ibid.</note> For whereas their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil conſiſted of one hundred Votes well nigh, yet they could not find forty to agree in this Vote. Onely the Emperours Vote concurring, put all the reſt to ſilence. But ſuch as the work, ſuch was the iſſue, for <hi>Gregory</hi> continued there not long, before not onely the Orthodox Chriſtians, but even the Arians alſo were weary of him; and for his cruel and bloody entrance, and his imperious government,<note place="margin">Soc. <hi>lib.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 10.

               <p>The Council at <hi>Antioch</hi> having thus done what they can againſt <hi>Athanaſius,</hi>

                  </note> have one thing more to do. For the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> had ſorely taxed this Council for ſiding with the Arians againſt the Nicene Council, unto which nevertheleſſe all the ſeveral members of this Council, or the moſt part of them, had ſubſcribed. This the Antiochian Council fear will ſtick upon them, for their conſciences told them that they had done ſomewhat that might de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve ſuch imputation; and that it would be a ſhame for ſo many learned men to be relapſed in a Council, and ſo many reverend Biſhops to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:62811:45"/>diſciples to <hi>Arius,</hi> who was but a Presbyter, defamed in his doctrine, life and death.

They are not faln from the Nicene Faith, nor will they own it. They will have a Confeſſion of their own, and yet will own none: They frame a Confeſſion and publiſh it, and then like it not.

                  </note> yet it ſeems that <hi>Athanaſius</hi> his Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion was ſomewhat more large then the Nicene, in the doctrine concerning the Holy Ghoſt, to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viate the Macedonian Hereſie which ſprang up of later times.

                           <p>We believe that the words, <hi>I and my Father are One,</hi> do ſignifie the unity of the Substance, which is together of the Father and the Son.</p>
                           <p>We believe that the Son doth raign together with the Father without beginning or ending, nor can his Kingdom be defined or determined by time. For that which is eternal can neither begin to be, nor ceaſe to be.</p>

And thereupon by the command of the Judges <hi>Stephen</hi> is baniſhed by the Biſhops, and depoſed from the See at <hi>Antioch,</hi> without any Act of Council. Nor did the Arians ſave ought of their honour thereby; for as they had put out <hi>Stephen</hi> for ſcandal, ſo they elect into his room <hi>Leontius,</hi> a man no leſſe filthy and unclean in converſation, and had, to add to all the reſe, caſtrated himſelf, that he might the more ſafely without ſcandal keep company with a woman whom he pretended to be a Virgin.

And thus after ten moneths,<note place="margin">Baron. <hi>An.</hi> 348. <hi>num.</hi> 14.</note> by adviſe he writes his Letters to the Emperour <hi>Conſtans.</hi> Letting him underſtand that <hi>Conſtantius</hi> was alwayes forward to execute the Order of the Council at <hi>Sardica,</hi> in the reſtitution of <hi>Athanaſius;</hi> and that he had kept the Church of <hi>Alexandria</hi> vacant now along time, expecting when <hi>Athanaſius</hi> would return, and that it was free for him to return when he pleaſed.</p>
               <p>How the Church at <hi>Alexandria</hi> became void,<note place="margin">Sect. <hi>3.</hi>
                  </note> will appear when <hi>Athanaſius</hi> returns: for as yet he truſted not <hi>Conſtantius</hi> his courteſie, but departed from <hi>Aquileia</hi> to <hi>Millain;</hi> where he had not been long ere he was ſaluted with a Letter from <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi> to himſelf, therein pitying <hi>Athanaſius</hi> his long ſufferings, and telling <hi>Athanaſius</hi> that <hi>Conſtantius</hi> had long ſince written to <hi>Athanaſius</hi> to come to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> but that he expected that <hi>Athana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius</hi> would long ere now have made application to him, for <hi>Athanaſius</hi> his reſtitution; but ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing <hi>Athanaſius</hi> afraid of his diſpleaſure, did there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore abſtain: And therefore <hi>Conſtantius</hi> now ſends to <hi>Athanaſius</hi> to invite his coming to <hi>Conſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople,</hi>
                  <pb n="107" facs="tcp:62811:55"/>promiſing him full and ſpeedy reſtitution; and further telling him, that he had written to his Brother <hi>Conſtans</hi> to ſend <hi>Athanaſius</hi> away accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly. <hi>Athanaſius</hi> is at this newes perplexed, as if too good to be true; and ſuppoſing if <hi>Conſtantius</hi> his favour were real, he might as well have ſent <hi>Athanaſius</hi> his Letters of free paſſage to <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria</hi> by Sea from <hi>Italy,</hi> with his Letters of peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able admittance to his Church, rather then to put him to adventure himſelf through many of his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies in ſo long and dangerous a journey by Land. But whiles <hi>Athanaſius</hi> is thus in demur what to do, another Letter comes to him from <hi>Conſtantius,</hi> with Letters from divers of his friends at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> importuning his ſpeedy coming away; and for his accommodations by the way, directions are given. And ſoon after all this, a third Letter comes from <hi>Conſtantius,</hi> by an expreſs Meſſenger, a Presbyter of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> who brings aſſurance of <hi>Conſtantius</hi> his real intentions for <hi>Athanaſius</hi> his good: and he eupon <hi>Athanaſius</hi> goes to <hi>Rome,</hi> to adviſe with the Biſhop and others, who are all for his going to <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> And they furniſh him with Letters of recommendation to the Alexandrian Churches,<note place="margin">Soc. <hi>lib.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 28.</note> and ſo they commend him to the bleſſing of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God.</p>
               <p>And accordingly Gods bleſſing did go along with him; for he paſſed to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> where find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the Emperour was gone to <hi>Antioch,</hi> he likewiſe went thither after him: And at that time <hi>Leontius</hi> was Biſhop of <hi>Antioch;</hi> in which City were a great number of Orthodox Chriſtians, unto whom the Arians there would not allow any
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:62811:56"/>publick Churches for their meeting, but ſuch of them as would be at the publick worſhip, muſt go to the Arian Congregations;<note place="margin">Sozom. <hi>lib.</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 19.</note> where <hi>Leontius</hi> ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs permitted them the liberty of their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences in all caſes, wherein the honour of the Son of God was concerned: And therefore when they came to ſing, <hi>Glory be to the Father, &amp;c.</hi> and thoſe that were Arians did ſing <hi>Glory be to the Father,</hi> they added thereto the words, <hi>In the Son;</hi> thereby declaring the Son of God to be infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour to the Father: Thoſe that were Orthodox would add theſe words, <hi>And the Son,</hi> declaring there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, that the ſame Glory due to the Father, was alſo due to the Son. But when <hi>Athanaſius</hi> was come, he would not joyn with the Arian Congregations, but did hold communion with the Orthodox, who were called Euſtathians, in private houſes. This be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing obſerved, haſtned <hi>Athanaſius</hi> his diſpatch with the Emperour; for it was not long ere he had ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs into the Emperours preſence, and received courteous entertainment from him, and within a few dayes obtained his diſmiſſion;<note place="margin">Soc. <hi>lib.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 18.</note> for they ſaw plainly, that the Orthodox Party was much heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by <hi>Athanaſius</hi> his preſence, and that <hi>Athana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius</hi> improved his little time of abode with them to the utmoſt for their ſpiritual benefit. The Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour therefore ſent for him the ſooner, and gave him Letters to the Alexandrian Churches, and to his Governours of the Country, importing that it was his will that <hi>Athanaſius</hi> ſhould be received and ſetled in his place in peace, and permitted ſo to continue under the Emperours protection. And unto all the reſt he added this one extraordinary ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:62811:56"/>of his favour; that he ſwore to him, that he would never hearken to any ſlanderous complaints againſt <hi>Athanaſius</hi> any more. And Iaſtly, he made a publick Edict, That all Acts and Orders againſt <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> or any of the Catholick Church,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Athan.</hi> Epiſt. ad Solit. vit.</note> ſhould be obliterated and made void, and that they all ſhould be reſtored to their former enjoyments. But when <hi>t Ahanaſius</hi> was taking of his leave of the Emperour, he ſaid to <hi>Athanaſius, Though you</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thanaſius <hi>are now restored to your place by the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, yet you are admitted and ſetled by my Authority; and therefore ſeeing that in</hi> Alexandria <hi>are divers who differ from you in judgment concerning ſome points in Religion, it is my request that you will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low them liberty of publick meeting, at ſome one Church within your City.</hi> To which <hi>Athanaſius</hi> anſwered, <hi>Its very just, yea neceſſary, that I ſhould obey your Imperial Majeſty; nor will I gainſay what your will is herein: But ſeeing alſo that this City of</hi> Antioch <hi>hath great multitudes therein, who cannot joyn with others of different judgment from mine, in doctrines concerning the Holy Trinity; I humbly beg for them the like favour, that they alſo may have a place of publick meeting at</hi> Antioch? This anſwer the Emperour diſliked not, but thought it reaſonable: Nevertheleſs the Arians upon fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther conſideration, conceiving that they thereby ſhould be greater looſers at <hi>Antioch,</hi> than gainers at <hi>Alexandria,</hi> ſuffered that matter to paſs in ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence: Which being obſerved by <hi>Leontius,</hi> he laying his hand upon his head (now white by reaſon of his age) ſaid, <hi>When this ſnow is melted away, there will appear much mud:</hi> intimating thereby the perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

               <p>
                  <hi>That after the death of</hi> Conſtans, Athanaſius <hi>was an aider and incourager of</hi> Magnentius <hi>to poſſeſſe himſelf of the Weſtern Empire, and to take up arms againſt</hi> Conſtantius; <hi>and to that end did hold intelligence with</hi> Magnentius, <hi>as is manifeſt by</hi> Atha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſius <hi>his Letters to</hi> Magnentius, <hi>ready to be produced.</hi>

               <p>Now was the Arian Schiſme boiled to its full height. For before the Council at <hi>Sardica</hi> baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Orthodox would ſatisfie the Arians; but now their diſpleaſure is become perfect hatred;

And thus <hi>Aetius</hi> is flattered by the people into that height that he is ſeparated, or otherwiſe ſeparates himſelf, from the other Arians at <hi>Antioch;</hi> and being ſo he ſtands out in maintaining the ſame, upon this account, that the other Arians had holden communion with <hi>Arius,</hi>
                  <pb n="120" facs="tcp:62811:62"/>after it was notoriouſly known that he had perjured,<note place="margin">Soz. <hi>lib.</hi> 4. <hi>cap.</hi> 11.</note> by his ſubmiſſion before <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> contrary to his own conſcience.

And firſt as touching the tumults at <hi>Alexandria,</hi> he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmeth that there were no ſuch upon his Arrival: that it is true there was a joyfull Aſſembly, but no bitterneſs nor diſpleaſure amongſt them, nor im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſonments or puniſhments, much leſs bloud-ſhed, death or baniſhments cauſed by them; but what was done in ſuch matters, was done by the Civil Magiſtrates upon miſdemeanours committed before his coming to <hi>Alexandria.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, That it never entred into his thought to imagine or contrive ſuch wickedneſs, as to ſtir up or maintain any difference or jealouſie between the Emperours <hi>Conſtans</hi> and <hi>Conſtantius;</hi> For he well knew it was a ſin exceeding hateful to God, to give the leaſt encouragement to ſtrife between brethren; much more between them, being Governours of the people: That <hi>Conſtans</hi> was not of ſo eaſie a belief, as to give any credit to informations againſt <hi>Conſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us.</hi> That although <hi>Athanaſius</hi> was divers times with <hi>Conſtans,</hi> yet never in private, nor without divers eminent perſons then preſent, who can teſtifie
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:62811:64"/>what he ſaid. And theſe perſon; <hi>Athanaſius</hi> men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned by name, and appealed to them to teſtifie what they knew concerning that matter.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, That <hi>Athanaſius</hi> never knew <hi>Magnen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius,</hi> nor did he ever ſend unto him, or received any letter or meſſage from him: and therefore thoſe letters ſuppoſed to be ſent to <hi>Magnentius</hi> by <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> and to be ready to be produced, are mere forgeries. That it is againſt all reaſon, to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine that <hi>Athanaſius</hi> ſhould hold any kind of intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence with that <hi>Magnentius,</hi> who had not only mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered the Patron of his own life, and Liege Lord, but the beſt friend under God, that ever <hi>Athanaſius</hi> had in the time of his neceſſity. <hi>Athanaſius</hi> further ſaid, that during the whole time of the unhappy Civil wars raiſed by <hi>Magnentius, Athanaſius</hi> was ſo far from wiſhing a good ſucceſs to <hi>Magnentius,</hi> that contrarily he ever publickly prayed to God to aid and aſſiſt <hi>Conſtantius</hi> againſt all his enemies; and the people alſo at the ſame time with loud voci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferations cried out, Lord help and aid <hi>Conſtantius.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Laſtly, as touching <hi>Athanaſius</hi> his diſobedience to the Emperours Orders; he knoweth not of any order, but what was mentioned to him by the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor of <hi>Egypt</hi> by word of mouth, without ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any in writing, and whereof <hi>Athanaſius</hi> had cauſe to doubt, in regard of the many late favours received by him from <hi>Conſtantius.</hi> And therefore <hi>Athanaſius</hi> told the Governour, if he had any ſuch order, it was unduly gained; as afterwards he was informed it was framed upon ſurmiſe of a Letter ſuppoſed to be written by <hi>Athanaſius</hi> to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The other invective (by thoſe at the Council at <hi>Antioch,</hi> and more ſpecially by <hi>Leontius;</hi>

For by reaſon of theſe perſecutions, ſome melancholick ſpirits dejected and diſtracted at the ſad apprehenſions ariſing from the preſent troubles, and ſeeing no hope of redreſs, choſe rather to withdraw themſelves from all ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar affairs and common ſociety, then to live con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually in ſuch troubles:<note place="margin">Nazian. <hi>Encom.</hi> Athan.</note> And (as <hi>Nazianzen</hi> ſaith) gave themſelves to a ſolitary life in Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſſes, and other places apart, to live to God more, and to the world leſs then other men do, who are buſied in earthly affairs every day. Amongſt which people, he ſaith that in his dayes were ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ſorts; ſome being Hermits, wholly abſent themſelves from all ſociety, and enjoy communion with God alone, knowing nothing of this world but ſolitarineſs. But others obſerve more the Law of Charity, by communion and ſociety together a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt themſelves: Theſe are ſolitary alſo in their kind, and dead to the affairs of the world, and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever turnings and changes there are in civil affairs, yet live they together in ſocieties, and are buſied in labour, reſerving themſelves nevertheleſs for the worſhip of God as their main end; accounting the men of the world impoſters, and are a world to

Thus far <hi>Nazianzen.</hi> If there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the apparel and diet of theſe men were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>handſome,<note place="margin">Soc. <hi>lib.</hi> 4. <hi>cap.</hi> 18.</note> mean, and in a manner ſordid, its not to be wondred at, conſidering that they looked on outward conveniences but as accidental to their main end, which was quietneſs of mind; and therefore they abhorred idleneſs, and accounted ſuch as did not labour to be rather Cheaters then Monks. This was a life not very ſuitable to fleſh and bloud, and yet in thoſe dayes were many mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes of them, eſpecially in the Egyptian Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſſes: and though thus retired they were, yet ſtill remained they under the ſurvey of the Biſhops;<note place="margin">Soz. <hi>lib.</hi> 6. <hi>cap.</hi> 28.</note> For its noted that <hi>Serapion</hi> one of the Egyptian Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops had under his alone government ten thouſand of them. They were alſo many of them learned men, and principal aſſerters of the doctrine Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox againſt the Hereticks in thoſe dayes; and their writings, continued to this age wherein we live, ſufficiently ſhew it. And with theſe men <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thanaſius</hi> was not unacquainted, no not when he was young; for even then he entred into acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance with that famous <hi>Authony</hi> the Monk, and did exceedingly obſerve, or rather ſerve him; he was in account the very founder of the Monaſtical life by way of profeſſion in the Wilderneſs of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt,</hi> and was a man of eminency for holineſs,<note place="margin">Athan. <hi>Vit.</hi> Anter.</note> not onely in the Wilderneſs, but even in the Courts of Princes, and the Emperour himſelf. And after that <hi>Athanaſius</hi> was Biſhop, he often delighted
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:62811:67"/>to viſit the Monks in their Cells, and to converſe with them; and now in his diſtreſſe he hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to theſe, as to his ſecureſt refuge on Earth.</p>
               <p>Nevertheleſſe this was not all the work that God had to do,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Sect.</hi> 5.</note> thus to gain a refuge for <hi>Athanaſius</hi> in the Wilderneſſe, nor is it all the end that <hi>Athana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius</hi> aimes at, thus to hide himſelf, for even in the Wilderneſſe there muſt be rule and government, and though men live as it were out of the World, yet the Devil and their luſts follow them; ſo as though theſe Monks, to avoid occaſions, do avoid af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, though they aime to draw nigh to God, yet ſoon begin to forget themſelves, and jarres and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions befal them there: No form of profeſſion, no ſeparation from Chriſtian Congregations and Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies, no nor from ſociety in worldly affairs with mankind, will be a remedy againſt ſchiſmes and errours. A Biſhop therefore, or (if that word pleaſe not) an Overſeer is as neceſſary in the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſſe as at <hi>Alexandria,</hi> to interpoſe, adviſe, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort, and by reproof to reduce men into wayes of Reaſon and Religion. And this proves to be <hi>Atha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſius</hi> his work now he is in the Wilderneſſe: For (to take up the words of <hi>Nazianzen</hi>) <hi>Athanaſius</hi> was a reconciler in all places where he had to do,<note place="margin">Nazian. <hi>Encom.</hi> Athan.</note> by his wiſdome and example. And in the Wilderneſſe now he labours to reduce amity and unity between the Monks and Hermites; letting them know that the holieſt Monks ſtand in need of a Viſitor or O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſeer. And that in a Biſhop, as <hi>Athanaſius</hi> was, may be an excellent temperature of a ſpeculative tranquility on the one part, and of practical mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:62811:68"/>in political affairs on the other. And that Monaſtical life conſiſted rather in gravity and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy in Chriſtian converſation, then in ſolitari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe or ſeparation. And by this means <hi>Athanaſius</hi> gained ſuch authority and reſpect amongſt theſe Wilderneſſe people, that what he pleaſed was a Law to them, and what he diſliked they accounted as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden and execrable.</p>
               <p>Whiles <hi>Athanaſius</hi> is thus out of the way,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Sect.</hi> 6.</note> men know not where nor which way; his enemies ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve and examine all travellers, watch ſuch as go out or come into <hi>Alexandria,</hi> ſearch the ſhips, ranſack the houſes, make enquiry, bring diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance amongſt the brethren, forrage the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, where ſuppoſing they have a ſcent of him, they ſearch the Cells, examine the Monks, but they had as good ask the ſtones. They do ſo highly honour <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> that they will not admit of any parly with the perſecutors, but offer their necks rather to the ſword, and if any of them meet with any hardſhip for <hi>Athanaſius</hi> his ſake, they endure it with courage, accounting it a high ſtrain of their profeſſion, even beyond their daily faſts and watchings, and proſtrations, and lying on the ground, which nevertheleſſe they held in a great account amongſt them.</p>
               <p>And yet is <hi>Athanaſius</hi> many times put to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream plunges.<note place="margin">

That none of the crimes charged againſt <hi>Athanaſius</hi> were ever proved, nor he ever allowed liberty to anſwer for himſelf; and that its notoriouſly known to all the World, that what had been done againſt <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> whether at the Council at <hi>Tyrus,</hi> or at the Council at <hi>Antioch,</hi> was not done to finde out and favour the truth, but to oppreſſe it. And which is yet worſe, it is evident that this their propoſal beginning againſt <hi>Athana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius,</hi> will end in the ſubverſion of the determinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Council at <hi>Nice,</hi> which the Weſtern Biſhops reſolved they would never yield unto; and thereupon they diſmiſs the Council. The Emperour <hi>Conſtantius</hi> finding himſelf neither feared nor loved, but contrarily that they are not afraid to declare in the publique Council, that his government was wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and unjuſt, he forth-with, without hearing of them, baniſhes divers of them.<note place="margin">

<q>Beſeeching him to hearken to the advice of his ſervant, now grown old in experience of the contrivances of the enemies of the Church, even the Arians whom he had well known and obſerved in their courſe, even from their firſt budding forth; and that he ever found them ſuch, as that he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but in faithfulneſſe unto him, beſeech him to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware of their wayes and Councils, which cannot en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure the light; and therefore would not appear at the Sardican Council, which was called by the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours own Authority, whereto alſo they were ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moned; and where their criminations againſt <hi>Atha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſius</hi> were found and declared malicious deceitful forgeries. And therefore it will not be for the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours Honour, nor peace of conſcience, to decline the advice of his Council of ſo many Biſhops fearing God and approving themſelves faithful to his Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial Majesty: Nor to engage his power and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority in the defence of thoſe dangerous and abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable errours of <hi>Arius;</hi> Much leſſe will it be ſafe for him to adventure ſo deeply in the purſuit of <hi>Athanaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi> without hearing of his cauſe; and first of all if he take into conſideration his former Letters, Meſſages, Promiſes, Oath, and publick Edicts. And as it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes <hi>Hoſſius</hi> in faithfulneſs to mind the Emperour hereof; ſo alſo will it not be unbecoming the Emperour to take it in good part; and therefore he prayed the Emperour to remember that he is a mortal man, and to fear the Day of Judgement, and to be ſure that

In the tranſaction thereof the Arians dealt cunning<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: For they made a Confeſſion of Faith, that on the one ſide aimed to ſtrike <hi>Photinus</hi> in the right vein; and which alſo on the other ſide may go down with <hi>Hoſſius</hi> and others of his way, and yet muſt be ſafe for the Arians to approve.

               <p>This Confeſſion thus framed, as on the one ſide it doth not aſſert that the Son is conſubſtantial with the Father, ſo on the other ſide it ſaith not in ſo many words that he is like to the Father. So being as it were ſilent in the point of ſimilitude, they hoped both the Orthodox and the Arian would ſubſcribe thereto, and agree in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning

                  </note> there were two other Confeſſions offered, which were ſuffered to paſſe abroad; but which of all theſe was offered to <hi>Photinus</hi> to ſubſcribe, appeareth not by the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory; but it appeareth that <hi>Photinus</hi> reſuſed to ſubſcribe, and unde took to deſend his opinions by diſpute; yet not ſatisfying the Council, they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared him excommunicated, and baniſhed him; and accordingly he retired himſelf all his dayes.

               <p>Of theſe two other Confeſſions one is wholy concealed by the Hiſtorians,<note place="margin">Sect. <hi>3.</hi>
                  </note> onely they ſay that therein that the words <hi>Subſtance</hi> and <hi>Conſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantial</hi> were not onely omitted, but expreſly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden to be uſed either in teaching or diſputation. For the way to bring in Hereſie, is to do it by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, they firſt conceal the words that do diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence truth from crrour, and then afterwards foiſt in words that may lead in their errours. But this is not all; for in the ſame Confeſſion thus concealed, they affirm, <hi>That the Father is greater then the Son in Honour, Dignity, and Deity, and in the Name Father. And that the Father is without beginning; and that the Generation of the Son is known onely to the Father.</hi> But as touching the third Confeſſion, although it be not concealed; yet it ſeems it was reſerved to be owned by another Council, as not ſo fitting for the preſent purpoſe, where ſuch di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Confeſſions were propounded, and the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:62811:75"/>each of them abounding in their own ſeveral ſences, might by multiplying debates break off without concluding againſt <hi>Photinus,</hi> and ſo evapo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate into nothing.</p>

And then they call for <hi>Liberius,</hi> now famous for his ſtout defence of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thanaſius</hi> before the Emperour: him they tell what others had done, and how that famous <hi>Hoſſius</hi> had agreed to their proceedings, and ſhewed to him his ſubſcription; and accordingly they require <hi>Libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi> to do the like. <hi>Liberius</hi> hereupon ſhewed himſelf the ſucceſſor of St. <hi>Peter</hi> too much, in that though he ſaid formerly three dayes, nor three months could change his reaſon, yet it ſeems three years did: For the Hiſtory mentions not otherwiſe,<note place="margin">Baron. <hi>An.</hi> 357. <hi>num.</hi> 46.</note> but that he ſubmitted to whatſoever they demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of him. But <hi>Hoſſius</hi> was much troubled for what he had done, and living not long after, made his laſt Will, and therein proteſted againſt the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:62811:76"/>cruelty and enforcement of his Subſcription, uttterly renouncing all the Arian opinions, and died Orthodox. Albeit there are not wanting ſome that make ſad conjectures concerning him, yet <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thanaſius</hi> bears him witneſs, that his infirmity here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in was (<hi>Seni imbecilitate,</hi> and <hi>exilii tadio</hi>) cauſed by the weakneſs of old age, and the miſery he had endured in his bainſhment,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Athan.</hi> Epiſt. ad Solit. Vit.</note> and that thereby he was <hi>(inpar verberibus)</hi> unable to endure tortures; and ſo he gave place for a time, yet a famous and worthy man he is in <hi>Athanaſius</hi> his eſteem. And as for <hi>Liberius, Baronius</hi> aſſureth us, that after he ſubſcribed, and returned to <hi>Rome,</hi> where he was formerly exceedingly beloved, there were many that took ſcandal at him, and made a ſchiſm in his Church, divers of them going along with <hi>Felix,</hi> who had been Biſhop in his abſence, and never would communicate with <hi>Liberius</hi> ſo long as <hi>Felix,</hi> lived; But after his death, they (upon many te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonies of <hi>Liberius</hi> his repentance) ſubmitted to joyn with him again.</p>
               <p>The falls of theſe two great lights of the Church (though thus cleared to all) ſhaked the Orthodox Chriſtians exceedingly, and made many to ſtag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger at the firſt news thereof, and may ſerve to mind, eſpecially old Profeſſors, (as <hi>Baronius</hi> doth) often to uſe that prayer of the Pſalmiſt, <hi>And now when I am old and gray headed, O Lord forſake me not;</hi> more eſpecially in this inſtant of apoſtacy wherein we now live.</p>
               <p>Thus the Council at <hi>Syrmium</hi> hath done ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what towards the advancement of the Arian Cauſe, yet upon cool conſideration, caſting up their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compts,
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:62811:76"/>they find little gains from their Confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; what they have gotten, they gained by ſcratch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and when they have it, they may put it in their eyes and ſee not one whit the worſe: Nay they begin to think themſelves looſers, and in the concluſion are ſorry for what they have done. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what is found in their Confeſſion, which can hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be defended from being contradictory to ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther clauſe therein; and thereupon to amend their error, they apply themſelves to the Emperour, to gain his Proclamation to call in all the Copies of their Confeſſion that paſſed abroad; which the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour does, with a penalty for ſuch as ſhall refuſe, or neglect to bring in ſuch Copies as they have; but all in vain, the recalling them in, makes them ſcatter the more abroad, and the error made more notorious; and in concluſion to repair their credit, they publiſh to the world the confeſſion of their Confeſſion, That ſomewhat was done <hi>per ſimulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem,</hi>

For if ſuch as ſeparate upon unwarrantable grounds may come to cheat in the confeſſion of their Faith, they will much more do it in the profeſſion of their life: But for all this, the Arians are neither ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in what they have done, nor in what they have undone; they therefore have another confeſſion of Faith in the Bank, which they reſerve for another Council to hold forth, for they cannot paſs it at <hi>Syrmium,</hi> and therefore they will have one Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil more, yea they will have many more; hoping at length that the Orthodox Biſhops will either be weary of coming to their Councils, and find ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſes
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:62811:77"/>of abſence; or if they come, that the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours preſence will ſo appal them, that they will be ſo wiſe as to keep ſilence, and ſuffer the game to go for the Arians without contradiction.</p>

Then the Acaſians move that the Confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Faith by the Council at <hi>Nice,</hi> ought firſt be abrogated and taken out of the way, before the Council could be free to conclude any matters con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the ſame. But the Semi-Arians like not that, reſolving to hold to the Nicene Faith, onely they would have ſome explanation or alteration of that word <hi>Conſubstantial.</hi> After long debate, <hi>Syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanus</hi> one of the Semi-Arians moved that the Confeſsion of Faith made by the Council at <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>och,</hi> might be taken into conſideration.

<pb n="157" facs="tcp:62811:80"/>and ſubſcribed, and whiles the ſame was thus paſsing at the Council, they cauſed the doors to be ſhut, to avoid interruption. <hi>Acaſius</hi> ſeeing the doors ſhut, told them that things done thus in ſecret are ſuſpicious; and deſired that they would delay that work, in regard that himſelf and others had in readineſſe another Confeſſion of Faith, which he produced, and deſired that the ſame might be read, which could not then be obtained.</p>

But on the fourth day <hi>Leonas</hi> appointed by the Emperor to preſerve the peace, interpoſed, and ſtretched his Authority ſo far, as he prevailed to have the Acaſian Confeſſion read in the Council; and thereupon the debate is renewed in the Council, for the framing of a new Confeſſion, but that whole day was alſo fruitleſly ſpent, and nothing could be concluded, and ſo the Council diſſolved for that day alſo: The next day the Council met again, but the Acaſians came not, then are they often called one by one, but none appearing, the Council proceeds againſt them as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerters, and baniſh them, and elect <hi>Ananias</hi> Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>Antioch,</hi> in the room of <hi>Eudoxius.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the Acaſians apprehend <hi>Aminus,</hi> and deliver him to <hi>Leonas</hi> by whom he is baniſhed.

               <p>Then the Council determined againſt the errour of <hi>Eudoxius,</hi> who denied the ſimilitude between the Father and the Son; and alſo againſt the er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours of the Macedonians;<note place="margin">Soc. <hi>lib.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 36.</note> and againſt the errours of the Apollinarians, who obſerving the differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces between the Arians and Semi-Arians, ſeparated from them both, and took up an opinion, <hi>That the Son of God aſſumed the body of Man without a ſoul, and after being convinced of that errour, yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that He had the Soul of a Man, but had not the mind of a Man, and that His God-head ſupplied</hi>
                  <pb n="177" facs="tcp:62811:90"/>inſtead thereof, and yet they did ſtill maintain the <hi>Conſubstantiality</hi> of the Perſons of the God-Head.</p>

               <p>Laſtly, <hi>Athanaſius</hi> at this Council recited his Apology for his flight into the Wilderneſſe, and retiring himſelf from <hi>Alexandria,</hi> which his Arian enemies, by way of ſcandalous imputation, called a diſerting of his place and truſt.</p>

His mind is neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe as good or ill as ever it was, and what he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſee done, he muſt betruſt to his Governours in their reſpective Countries, and theſe commands are extended as far as to <hi>Alexandria;</hi> where <hi>Atha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſius</hi> is all this while feeding of his flock, where alſo was the main Butt at which all <hi>Eudoxius</hi> his Councils aimed.

But the Alexandrians were provided what to do, for the noiſe of this tempeſt roared long before it came. And the Alexandrians are ſoon come together to adviſe about an anſwer, and with one accord tell the Governour, that he ought ſeriouſly to adviſe what he did, before he did determine ought againſt <hi>Athanaſius.</hi> For the Governour muſt know that <hi>Athanaſius</hi> is not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the compaſſe of the Emperours Edict; for that

But the people reſolving to make good their concluſion, told the Governour plainly they would not part with <hi>Athanaſius</hi> upon ſo eaſie terms, as they had an intereſt in him, they would maintain it, and therewith made a proffer of a general Inſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.

And in the mean time <hi>Athanaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> hath the Governours aſſurance that he ſhall continue at <hi>Alexandria</hi> without diſturbance.

               <p>Whether the Governour informed the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour hereof or not,<note place="margin">Sect. <hi>6.</hi>
                  </note> I do not find.

By this time the Governours purpoſes are ripe for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution, and he comes ſuddenly in the night to <hi>Alexandria,</hi> the weather dark and ſtormy, but him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf the greateſt ſtorme, and entring the City, with a ſtrong guard of ſouldiers beſets the houſe of <hi>Atha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſius</hi> on all ſides, and at once breaking in at the

The people on the other ſide as much wondered as they, ſome conclude that he had Revelations from God, who doubtleſſe was the principal Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker in his eſcape. Others conclude that <hi>Athanaſius</hi> was not led by jealouſie of the Governour, ſo much, as of the people, whoſe inclinations he ſaw were mutinous, and if any death or bloud-ſhed ſhould enſue thereupon, it might be wholly impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to him, and that therefore he reſolving not to be party in any ſuch motions, with-drew himſelf. But the greateſt wonder on all hands is what ſhould become of him, of whom they can find neither ſcent nor foot-ſteps, neither in the Wilderneſſe nor City, neither amongſt enemies nor friends. And no marvel if it be true that all this while he was hidden in his fathers Monument, for the ſpace of four moneths, as one free amongſt the dead; for who would ſeek for the living amongſt the dead? nor is it altogether impoſſible, if the large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the Egyptian Monuments be conſidered, and that though for the moſt part it might be the place of his ordinary retirement, yet he might find opportune times to look abroad for the freſh aire.

And by that means the people might the better learn to ſerve God and live in obedience under him, and in peace with each other; and therefore adviſed them to proceed to the election of ſuch an one, having reſpect alſo that he muſt be ſuch an one whom the Emperour might reſt upon for advice, exhortation and reproof. The Biſhops anſwered that they would be glad to underſtand the
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:62811:108"/>Emperours mind more particularly, by nomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the man. But the Emperour refuſed, alledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it was their work to determine the nomination. The Biſhops go to their work, but the heat grew ſo great, eſpecially from the people of the Arian part, that a tumult enſues, (as is uſual in all popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar elections, eſpecially where Church matters are concerned) and <hi>Ambroſe</hi> the Governour of <hi>Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain</hi> under the Emperour hearing thereof, comes ſuddenly into the Church, and commands them to be careful to obſerve good order, and carry themſelves gravely and ſoberly, as becomes their places, and the work they were about.

For it ſeems that the times were ſo trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome as that men were not over forward to take up that Honourable Badge of Baptiſme, although they were capable; for even children of Believers were baptized by a known cuſtome in the Church
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:62811:108"/>before <hi>Origens</hi> time (if we may believe him) and by tradition from the Apoſtolick Age. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> baptiſed thus willingly, is nevertheleſſe abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reſolved againſt their Epiſcopal Election, ſo as the matter comes before the Emperour, who won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring at the concluſion, but more at the unanimity thereof, ſaith its Gods work, and confirmes the Election without further debate,<note place="margin">Theod. <hi>lib.</hi> 4. <hi>c.</hi> 7.</note> and ſo <hi>Ambroſe</hi> is ordained, and the Emperour himſelf giving pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick thanks to God.</p>
               <p>This way that <hi>Valentinian</hi> took in ſeeming to be rather ruled in Church matters, then to rule, was wiſely contrived by him; conſidering that if he had led on the work, his wife would have led him, for ſhe was a paſſionate Arian, and ſeeing ſhe cannot now ſtop this election of <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> ſhe nevertheleſſe reſolves perfect enmity againſt him, and accordingly maintained it all her dayes; and by her wiviſh and womaniſh ſolicitations ſo hampered <hi>Valentinian</hi> in his proceedings, that he can nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther appear to ſtop his brother <hi>Valenſes</hi> rage a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Orthodox in the Eaſt, as he would have done; nor proceed againſt the Arians in the Weſt, as he ſhould have done: <hi>Valentinian</hi> nevertheleſſe did ſomewhat in both particulars, and would have done more, but that he had to do with a willful wife, and a deſpiteful brother; and thus the Churches in the Eaſt muſt ſtill ſuffer Perſecution, and in the Weſt a kind of Tolleration, which is next door thereto, until God ſhall otherwiſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide.</p>

Now theſe <hi>Anthropomorphites</hi> will have the likeneſſe of God and the likenſſe of man to be one and the ſame thing; thereby confound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſubſtances of both, by a ſtrange Expoſition of thoſe words,<note place="margin">Theod. <hi>lib.</hi> 4. <hi>c.</hi> 20.</note> 
                  <hi>Let us make man in our own I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage;</hi> whereby they will have God to be in the Image of man, and think themſelves to have here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in attained a high ſtrain of underſtanding in this Divine Miſtery above all others. Thus profeſſing themſelves wiſe, they become fools.</p>
               <p>Another Sect alſo aroſe about theſe times, whom I call not Hereticks. For they held forth the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Trinity and other Doctrines funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental; and theſe were called Meſſalians, or as now adayes Enthyſiaſts, a praying people, who fancied themſelves directed by immediate inſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Holy Ghoſt, giving much reſpect to dreams, laying aſide bodily labour, holding their conceits prophetical, and yet did not (as the Quakers now-adayes) either ſeparate from the
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:62811:109"/>publick Congregations; or make diſturbance in them, but attended on them quietly, although they held them but as Tollerable things, doing neither good nor hurt; although they profeſſedly hold it not forth in plain words. They eſteem Baptiſme uſeleſſe, but highly extol prayer, which if daily uſed, they think themſelves thereby guard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed againſt all Temptations; for they ſay thereby the Devil is put to flight; and that then the Holy Ghoſt comes down ſenſibly and manifeſts himſelf, and yet nevertheleſſe inviſibly; and that hereby their body is freed from trouble, and their mind from all ill inclinations; ſo as there is no more need of faſting to tame the body, or of teaching and inſtruction; and that they are ſafe againſt fleſhly temptations, and ſhall fore-ſee things to come, and behold the Trinity with their eyes.</p>
               <p>But theſe two Sects came to no great eſteem a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the Profeſſors in any Religion; the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer being ſo apparantly grounded in ignorance, was oppoſed by both the Nicenian and Arian, for it was deſtructive to the principles of both. And the later as ill founded, <hi>viz.</hi> upon a meer ſolitary Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholick Fancy, that no other man could conceit, but ſuch as were inthralled therewith; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Orthodox Biſhops no leſſe then the Arian, did both of them within their ſeveral precincts, find means to quench in a ſhort ſpace both thoſe brands of contention, and ſoon effected it.</p>

               <p>A ſad age this was now grown; being nigh the expiring of the fourth Century, wherein the Church of God finds no refuge from the rage of perſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, no not in the Wilderneſſe, nor in any Nation
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:62811:113"/>under Heaven. For the Kings of <hi>Italy, Spain,</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> are Arians, and the Affrican Kings like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe. The Franks, Brittiſh, and German Kings are Pagans, and the people generally, although God had his Church amongſt them. The Eaſtern Churches are all under an Apoſtate Emperour, who common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly are worſe for their Apoſtacy, then thoſe that never owned the truth. And yet God found out ſuch hiding places, that his Church was not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed nor diminiſhed thereby, but rather increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed; for within twenty years we find mention of ſix Councils at <hi>Rome,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Bin. <hi>Conc.</hi>
                  </note> and five Councils more in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther places of the Weſt; and in the Eaſt <hi>Anasta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi> the Apoſtate Emperour dying, the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment falls to <hi>Juſtinus,</hi> under whom the Churches recovered their former liberty as long as the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire it ſelf laſted. And <hi>Juſtinian</hi> his Succeſſor, by his Captains <hi>Belliſarius</hi> and <hi>Narſes</hi> both freed <hi>Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frick</hi> from the Vandals,<note place="margin">Evag. <hi>Hiſt. lib.</hi> 4. <hi>cap.</hi> 16, 20, 23.</note> and <hi>Italy</hi> from the Goths and ſet the Orthodox Churches at liberty. After which the Eaſtern Empire coming to <hi>Phocas,</hi> he advanced the Roman See above all the Churches, and the influence of that See for the ſpace of a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years following blaſted the Arians; till the Francks gaining the Imperial power in the Weſt under the Line of <hi>Charlemaine,</hi> and after them the Saxon and German Emperours, to whom the Weſtern Empire devolved from the Francks; all of them as Sons of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> joyned their Civil Power with his Eccleſiaſtical Power, in ſuppreſſing the Arians in all places. So as from the time of <hi>Justinian</hi> the Emperour, the Arian intereſt is ſcarce mentioned in Story. One chief
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:62811:114"/>cauſe whereof was the want of countenance from the Civil Power.</p>
               <p>A ſecond cauſe hereof,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Sect.</hi> 6.</note> and yet the more princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal, was the preaching of the Goſpel. For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though that was in no great favour generally with the Civil Power, yet the bare tolleration of the ſame permitted it to work out its own way; and as the Emperour <hi>Valens</hi> had propagated Arianiſme amongſt the Goths on the one ſide, ſo on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther after he was dead, the Eaſtern Churches by the advice of <hi>Chryſostome</hi> from the Eaſt,<note place="margin">Theod. <hi>lib.</hi> 5. <hi>c.</hi> 31.</note> and the Brittiſh and other Churches from the Weſt (after the tide of the Goths was paſt) ſent prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers of the Orthodox Doctrine amongſt thoſe Northern and Eaſtern Nations, by means whereof the Goſpel coming amongſt others to the Burgun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians, then oppreſſed by the Hunnes, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived it,<note place="margin">Nancler. <hi>Hiſt. Vit.</hi> 2. <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.</note> and by marriage of one of their Ladies to <hi>Clodoveus,</hi> one of the Line of the Franks it came to <hi>Charlemain;</hi> and thus the conquered con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quering the Conquerour, even the Arian Kings themſelves convinced by the Goſpel, proved real friends to the Orthodox Churches, and others not convinced, yet for their own peace ſake, are contented to connive at the liberty of the ſame.</p>
               <p>A third cauſe of the ſubverſion of the Arian Schiſme was their own diviſions.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Sect.</hi> 7. Soz. <hi>lib.</hi> 7. <hi>cap.</hi> 20.</note> For beſides the ſeveral Sects thereof in the life time of <hi>Athanaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us, Eunomius</hi> one of higheſt eſteem amongſt them, dying ſoon after, his diſciples are divided in their opinions;<note place="margin">Soc. <hi>lib.</hi> 5. <hi>cap.</hi> 22, 23</note> ſome affirming with <hi>Eunomius, That the Son of God is unlike the Father,</hi> and others
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:62811:114"/>reaching a ſtrain beyond that, affirm, <hi>That God is not alwayes like Himſelf;</hi> and hereupon one Schiſme more ariſes. Another Schiſme after this appeared upon ſlighter grounds; for one of the Members of their Church being eſteemed to have more excellent parts then the Eunomian Biſhop had,<note place="margin">Soz. <hi>lib.</hi> 7. <hi>cap.</hi> 17.</note> the Biſhop (fearing his light would be darkened) takes occaſion of diſpleaſure at him, and excommunicated him; the excommunicate member hereupon gains a Sect, and maintains another Schiſme. A third Schiſme further grows up upon another difference in opinion; for ſome of them teach, <hi>That God was not to be called Father, before Chriſt was born;</hi> theſe are alſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated by others, and gather into ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Congregation. And thus Sects multiply and maintain Schiſme with that aſperity that they ſpare not one another ſo far as their power can extend: <hi>Separation upon unwarrantable grounds, can breed naught elſe but Schiſme, and he that ſeeketh comfort therein, will be deceived there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Laſtly, Arianiſme received no ſmall blow from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Hereſies that would not conſiſt with it,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Sect.</hi> 8.</note> and all of them gathering Churches out of the Arian Churches; as they had formerly robbed the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox Churches, to make up their own: Such were the Pricillianiſts, Pelagians, Neſtorians, Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tychians beſides other petit Sects bred up under them. And laſt of all, and above all the reſt, came two grand Sects, the one in the Eaſt and the other in the Weſt; and theſe two devoured all the reſt. That in the Weſt was the Papal power in
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:62811:115"/>the Roman See, which came precariouſly, and by a kind of cheat, about the beginning of the Sixth Century, at which time the Roman Biſhop had obtained of the Emperour of the Eaſt to be the Univerſal Biſhop, and thereby gained a high feat in the conſciences of men,<note place="margin">Plat. <hi>Vit.</hi> Bonifac. 3.</note> and whiles they are highly eſteemed for their ſervice againſt <hi>Arius,</hi> in defence of the God-Head of the Son of God, they cunningly ſlip themſelves into co-partner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip with the Son of God in all his Offices, and were countenanced by the Imperial Power, till they had ſubdued both Emperour and all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der themſelves. The other Sect aroſe in the Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtern Churches, about twenty years after the former, in the Raign of <hi>Heraclius,</hi> who ſucceeded <hi>Phocas,</hi> but this comes in with a force;<note place="margin">Zonar. <hi>Tom.</hi> 3. <hi>in Vit.</hi> Herac.</note> and ſwallowed up not onely the ſeven famous Churches of <hi>Aſia,</hi> but all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Chuches both of <hi>Aſia</hi> and <hi>Affrica,</hi> bringing with them a rabble of doctrines gathered out of all religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, all of them patronized by <hi>Mahomet,</hi> and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely contrived by the Devil, not onely againſt the Natures and Offices of Chriſt, but againſt the Trinity. Theſe firſt made way into the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire by the Sarazens Sword,<note place="margin">Naucler. <hi>Vol.</hi> 2. <hi>Con.</hi> 22. <hi>&amp;</hi> 34.</note> and held the power there by the ſpace of ſix or ſeven hundred years. And after them they obtained the power of the Turkiſh Sword, which conquered not onely what the Sarazens had in <hi>Aſia</hi> and <hi>Affrica,</hi> but gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed alſo a great part of <hi>Europe,</hi> and ſwallowing up the Chriſtian Churches in thoſe places, left ſcarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Name of Chriſtianity remaining; ſaving a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout eight or nine poor Sects of Chriſtians, who live in miſerable ſlavery under them. <hi>And thus
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:62811:115"/>the once famous Eastern Churches have made a ſad and lamentable account of their Progreſſe from <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity to Separation, from thence to Schiſme, ſo to Enmity, thence to Perſecution, and laſtly to Heatheniſme.
